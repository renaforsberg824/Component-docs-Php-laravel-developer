### Sending Data in Request Body

A request body is data sent by the client to your API. You will need to send body data with requests whenever you need to modify data in the API . *E.g when sending a request to add a new student to a college database, you might include the student's data in `JSON`.*

The body section is typically used when you choose the following methods:
- `PUT`
- `POST`
- `PATCH`

The Body tab in Hoppscotch allows you to specify the data you need to send with a request.
You can choosefrom the dropdown menu various different content-types of body data to suit your API.

<alert>
By default, Hoppscotch will select Noneâ€”leave it selected if you do not need to send a body with your request.
