**Access APIs blocked by CORS restriction by using either proxyscotch/custom middleware or Hoppscotch web extension.**

## Using Proxy

Enable proxy in settings.

You can replace this with your own proxy middleware if you wish.

#### Using custom Middle ware

Since `CORS` is as simple as adding some HTTP headers, and itâ€™s the only browser blocked, you can build some proxy-like component that will basically make a call for you, get the response from the desired API, add those headers on top, and then send it back to Hoppscotch.

### Using Hoppscotch Web Extension

1. Download the Hoppscotch browser extension [here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hoppscotch-browser-extens/amknoiejhlmhancpahfcfcfhllgkpbld?hl=en)

2. Enable it in settings.

3. Open the extension and add new origins

Hoppscotch extension routes all added origins to Proxy.
